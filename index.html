					<td class=description>The IntelliSpace portal application utilizes .NET Remoting for its functionality. The vulnerability arises from the exploitation of port 755 through the deserialization vulnerability. After analyzing the configuration files, we observed that the server had set the TypeFilterLevel to Full which is dangerous as it can potentially lead to remote code execution using deserialization. This issue affects IntelliSpace Portal: 12 and prior.</td>

					<td class=description>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as javascript:alert(). Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link. An attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks, or modification of the user interface behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.</td>

					<td class=description>mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions >= 2.4.16.11.</td>
