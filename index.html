					<td class=description>There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile"
module.





When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods
of "zipfile.ZipFile" like "namelist()", "iterdir()", "extractall()", etc)
the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted
zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting
the contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling
user-controlled zip archives are not affected.</td>
