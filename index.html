					<td class=description>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. When editing content that contains "dangerous" macros like malicious script macros that were authored by a user with fewer rights, XWiki warns about the execution of these macros since XWiki 15.9RC1. These required rights analyzers that trigger these warnings are incomplete, allowing an attacker to hide malicious content. For most macros, the existing analyzers don't consider non-lowercase parameters. Further, most macro parameters that can contain XWiki syntax like titles of information boxes weren't analyzed at all. Similarly, the "source" parameters of the content and context macro weren't anylzed even though they could contain arbitrary XWiki syntax. In the worst case, this could allow a malicious to add malicious script macros including Groovy or Python macros to a page that are then executed after another user with programming righs edits the page, thus allowing remote code execution. The required rights analyzers have been made more robust and extended to cover those cases in XWiki 16.4.7, 16.10.3 and 17.0.0.</td>

					<td class=description>Description

In Spring Framework, versions 6.0.x as of 6.0.5, versions 6.1.x and 6.2.x, an application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when it sets a “Content-Disposition” header with a non-ASCII charset, where the filename attribute is derived from user-supplied input.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all the following are true:

  *  The header is prepared with org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.
  *  The filename is set via ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset).
  *  The value for the filename is derived from user-supplied input.
  *  The application does not sanitize the user-supplied input.
  *  The downloaded content of the response is injected with malicious commands by the attacker (see RFD paper reference for details).


An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:

  *  The application does not set a “Content-Disposition” response header.
  *  The header is not prepared with org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.
  *  The filename is set via one of:  *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String), or
  *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, ASCII)



  *  The filename is not derived from user-supplied input.
  *  The filename is derived from user-supplied input but sanitized by the application.
  *  The attacker cannot inject malicious content in the downloaded content of the response.


Affected Spring Products and VersionsSpring Framework:

  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.7
  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.20
  *  6.0.5 - 6.0.28
  *  Older, unsupported versions are not affected


MitigationUsers of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

Affected version(s)Fix versionAvailability6.2.x6.2.8OSS6.1.x6.1.21OSS6.0.x6.0.29 Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/ No further mitigation steps are necessary.


CWE-113 in `Content-Disposition` handling in VMware Spring Framework versions 6.0.5 to 6.2.7 allows remote attackers to launch Reflected File Download (RFD) attacks via unsanitized user input in `ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset)` with non-ASCII charsets.</td>
