					<td class=description>The Phoenix Code's configuration on macOS, specifically the presence of entitlements: "com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables" and "com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation" allows for Dynamic Library (Dylib) injection. A local attacker with unprivileged access can use environment variables like DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to successfully inject code in application's context andÂ bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

This issue was fixed in commit 0c75fb57f89d0b7d9b180026bc2624b7dcf807da</td>

A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands as the root user, potentially compromising the entire device.</td>

					<td class=description>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Aquatronica Controller System firmware versions <= 5.1.6 and web interface versions <= 2.0. The tcp.php endpoint fails to restrict unauthenticated access, allowing remote attackers to issue crafted POST requests and retrieve sensitive configuration data, including plaintext administrative credentials. Exploitation of this flaw can lead to full compromise of the system, enabling unauthorized manipulation of connected devices and aquarium parameters.</td>

					<td class=description>A PHP object injection vulnerability exists in SugarCRM versions prior to 6.5.24, 6.7.13, 7.5.2.5, 7.6.2.2, and 7.7.1.0 due to improper validation of PHP serialized input in the SugarRestSerialize.php script. The vulnerable code fails to sanitize the rest_data parameter before passing it to the unserialize() function. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to submit crafted serialized data containing malicious object declarations, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the application context. Although SugarCRM released a prior fix in advisory sugarcrm-sa-2016-001, the patch was incomplete and failed to address some vectors.</td>

Attackers can bypass authentication by including specially crafted text in the request URL or message header, and then inject arbitrary malicious commands into some fields related to ACL access control list and user group functions and execute to obtain the highest ROOT privileges of remote devices, thereby completely taking over the remote target devices.</td>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
