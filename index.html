					<td class=description>A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in funnyzpc Mee-Admin up to 1.6. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /mee/login of the component Login. The manipulation of the argument username leads to observable response discrepancy. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.</td>

					<td class=description>The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Authorization in versions 3.1 through 3.3.4. This is due to a lack of sufficient validation checks within the 'verify_guest_email' function to ensure the requesting user is the intended recipient of the purchase receipt. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and view the receipts of other users, which contains a link to download paid content. Successful exploitation requires knowledge of another customers email address as well as the file ID of the content they purchased.</td>
