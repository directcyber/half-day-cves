					<td class=description>Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. The application allows users to upload files with scripts in the filename parameter. As a result, a malicious user can upload a script file to the system. When users in the application use the "Diff or Compare" functionality, they are affected by a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.2.9.</td>
