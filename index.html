					<td class=description>In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application.</td>

This vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.</td>

					<td class=description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.
This issue affects Junos OS:

					<td class=description>lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to an authentication issue due to improper validation of email addresses during the signup process. Specifically, the server fails to treat email addresses as case insensitive, allowing the creation of multiple accounts with the same email address by varying the case of the email characters. For example, accounts for 'abc@gmail.com' and 'Abc@gmail.com' can both be created, leading to potential impersonation and confusion among users.</td>

					<td class=description>parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to insufficient protection over sensitive endpoints. The application checks if the host parameter is not '0.0.0.0' to restrict access, which is inadequate when the application is bound to a specific interface, allowing unauthorized access to endpoints such as '/restart_program', '/update_software', '/check_update', '/start_recording', and '/stop_recording'. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service, unauthorized disabling or overriding of recordings, and potentially other impacts if certain features are enabled in the configuration.</td>

					<td class=description>An issue was discovered in gradio-app/gradio, where the `/component_server` endpoint improperly allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with attacker-controlled arguments. Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized local file read access, posing a significant risk especially when the application is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`, thereby allowing remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps hosted on `huggingface.co` are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.</td>

					<td class=description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `_create_model_version()` function within `server/handlers.py` of the mlflow/mlflow repository, due to improper validation of the `source` parameter. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a `source` parameter that bypasses the `_validate_non_local_source_contains_relative_paths(source)` function's checks, allowing for arbitrary file read access on the server. The issue arises from the handling of unquoted URL characters and the subsequent misuse of the original `source` value for model version creation, leading to the exposure of sensitive files when interacting with the `/model-versions/get-artifact` handler.</td>

This vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted JPEG or TGA image file to a software using ImageSharp, potentially disclosing sensitive information from other parts of the software in the resulting image buffer.
