					<td class=description>pimcore/customer-data-framework is the Customer Management Framework for management of customer data within Pimcore. An authenticated and unauthorized user can access the GDPR data extraction feature and query over the information returned, leading to customer data exposure. Permissions are not enforced when reaching the `/admin/customermanagementframework/gdpr-data/search-data-objects` endpoint allowing an authenticated user without the permissions to access the endpoint and query the data available there. An unauthorized user can access PII data from customers. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.0.6.

					<td class=description>Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed on top of the Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage their IP Address space easily and effectively. By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.

However, the API also exposes `test_config_cmd`, `reload_cmd` and `restart_cmd`. While the UI doesn't allow users to modify any of these settings, it is possible to do so by sending a request to the API. This issue may lead to authenticated Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Information Disclosure. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.beta.9.</td>
