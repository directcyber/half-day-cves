This affects the server-side part of giscus, which is provided via http://giscus.app or your own self-hosted service. This vulnerability is fixed by the c43af7806e65adfcf4d0feeebef76dc36c95cb9a and 4b9745fe1a326ce08d69f8a388331bc993d19389 commits.</td>

					<td class=description>The parisneo/lollms repository is affected by a timing attack vulnerability in the `authenticate_user` function within the `lollms_authentication.py` file. This vulnerability allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames and guess passwords incrementally by analyzing response time differences. The affected version is the latest, and the issue is resolved in version 20.1. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's default string equality operator for password comparison, which compares characters sequentially and exits on the first mismatch, leading to variable response times based on the number of matching initial characters.</td>

The bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.</td>
