					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work

The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(),
which does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel->dprx_work has
fully completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free
scenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while
tunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel
in tb_dp_dprx_work().

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0                            | CPU 1
tb_dp_tunnel_active()            |
  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()
    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()
      tb_dp_activate()           |
        tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker
          cancel_delayed_work()  |
    tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |
                                 |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF
                                 |   tunnel-> //UAF

Replacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is
not feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()
and the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()
would wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.

Instead, implement proper reference counting:
- If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release
  the reference in the stop function.
- If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the
  reference is released in delayed work function itself.

This ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution
while preventing memory leaks.

This bug was found by static analysis.</td>
