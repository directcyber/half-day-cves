					<td class=description>A vulnerability was found in FunAudioLLM InspireMusic up to bf32364bcb0d136497ca69f9db622e9216b029dd. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function load_state_dict of the file inspiremusic/cli/model.py of the component Pickle Data Handler. The manipulation leads to deserialization. An attack has to be approached locally. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. The name of the patch is 784cbf8dde2cf1456ff808aeba23177e1810e7a9. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.</td>
