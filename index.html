					<td class=description>The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace.</td>

					<td class=description>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Apache Superset. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. This issue is a follow-up to CVE-2024-39887 with additional disallowed PostgreSQL functions now included: query_to_xml_and_xmlschema, table_to_xml, table_to_xml_and_xmlschema.

This issue affects Apache Superset: <4.1.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.0, which fixes the issue or add these Postgres functions to the config set DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS.</td>

This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.</td>
