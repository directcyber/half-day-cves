					<td class=description>A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in KDE Plasma Workspace up to 5.93.0. This affects the function EventPluginsManager::enabledPlugins of the file components/calendar/eventpluginsmanager.cpp of the component Theme File Handler. The manipulation of the argument pluginId leads to path traversal. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The patch is named 6cdf42916369ebf4ad5bd876c4dfa0170d7b2f01. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-253407. NOTE: This requires write access to user's home or the installation of third party global themes.</td>

					<td class=description>OpenRefine is a free, open source power tool for working with messy data and improving it. A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7) where an attacker may construct a JDBC query which may read files on the host filesystem. Due to the newer MySQL driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30), there is no associated deserialization utilization point, so original code execution cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server. This issue has been addressed in version 3.7.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>
