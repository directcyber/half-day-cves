					<td class=description>KEDA is a Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling component. Prior to versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3, an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability has been identified in KEDA, potentially affecting any KEDA resource that uses TriggerAuthentication to configure HashiCorp Vault authentication. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect or insufficient path validation when loading the Service Account Token specified in spec.hashiCorpVault.credential.serviceAccount. An attacker with permissions to create or modify a TriggerAuthentication resource can exfiltrate the content of any file from the node's filesystem (where the KEDA pod resides) by directing the file's content to a server under their control, as part of the Vault authentication request. The potential impact includes the exfiltration of sensitive system information, such as secrets, keys, or the content of files like /etc/passwd. This issue has been patched in versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3.</td>

					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
sg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
freed.

The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully
submitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then
the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().</td>
