Prior to version 2.69.1, the OAuth client creation and update endpoints of the Fides Webserver API do not properly authorize scope assignment. This allows highly privileged users with `client:create` or `client:update` permissions to escalate their privileges to owner-level. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.</td>

					<td class=description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Webserver API's built-in IP-based rate limiting is ineffective in environments with CDNs, proxies or load balancers. The system incorrectly applies rate limits based on directly connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs, and stores counters in-memory rather than in a shared store. This allows attackers to bypass intended rate limits and potentially cause denial of service. This vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in rate limiting for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API gateways, etc.) are not affected. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. There are no application-level workarounds. However, rate limiting may instead be implemented externally at the infrastructure level using a WAF, API Gateway, or similar technology.</td>

					<td class=description>Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Admin UI login endpoint relies on a general IP-based rate limit for all API traffic and lacks specific anti-automation controls designed to protect against brute-force attacks. This could allow attackers to conduct credential testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. For organizations with commercial Fides Enterprise licenses, configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) through an OIDC provider (like Azure, Google, or Okta) is an effective workaround. When OIDC SSO is enabled, username/password authentication can be disabled entirely, which eliminates this attack vector. This functionality is not available for Fides Open Source users.</td>

Prior to version 2.69.1, admin UI user password changes in Fides do not invalidate active user sessions, creating a vulnerability chaining opportunity where attackers who have obtained session tokens through other attack vectors (such as XSS) can maintain access even after password reset. This issue is not directly exploitable on its own and requires a prerequisite vulnerability to obtain valid session tokens in the first place. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.</td>

					<td class=description>A vulnerability ( CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord ) exists in EOL ASP.NET when closing an HTTP/3 stream while application code is writing to the response body, a race condition may lead to use-after-free, resulting in Remote Code Execution.

  Per  CWE-416: Use After Free https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html , Use After Free is when a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

  This issue affects EOL ASP.NET 6.0.0 <= 6.0.36 as represented in this CVE, as well as 8.0.0 <= 8.0.8, 9.0.0-preview.1.24081.5 <= 9.0.0.RC.1 as represented in  CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord .

  Additionally, if you've deployed  self-contained applications https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd  targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.

   NOTE: This CVE only represents End Of Life (EOL) software components. The vendor, Microsoft, has indicated there will be no future updates nor support provided upon inquiry.</td>

A maliciously crafted filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../../../windows/system32/file.txt) or illegal characters that, when processed, would cause the file to be written outside of the intended target directory. An attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or application configuration files, leading to a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution, depending on the context in which the library is used.  The vulnerability is particularly critical for users on Windows systems, but all operating systems are affected. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.1.</td>
