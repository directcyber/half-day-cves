Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/sys/admin.html. The manipulation leads to cross site scripting. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available.</td>

Due to a flaw in multi-line SNMP result parser, authenticated users can inject malformed OIDs in the response. When processed by ss_net_snmp_disk_io() or ss_net_snmp_disk_bytes(), a part of each OID will be used as a key in an array that is used as part of a system command, causing a command execution vulnerability.

					<td class=description>A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in TP-Link TL-SG108E 1.0.0 Build 20201208 Rel. 40304. Affected is an unknown function of the file /usr_account_set.cgi of the component HTTP GET Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument username/password leads to use of get request method with sensitive query strings. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.0.0 Build 20250124 Rel. 54920(Beta) is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was contacted early. They reacted very professional and provided a pre-fix version for their customers.</td>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included.</td>

					<td class=description>7-Zip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25456.</td>
