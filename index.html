Prior to version 2.0.30, there is an HTML injection vulnerability in plaintext e-mails generated by Mailgen. Projects are affected if the Mailgen.generatePlaintext(email) method is used and given user-generated content. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.30. A workaround involves stripping all HTML tags before passing any content into Mailgen.generatePlaintext(email).</td>

Specifically, the `/cgi-bin/vitogate.cgi` endpoint is affected, when the `form` JSON parameter is set to `form-0-2`. The vulnerability stems from the fact that that function at offset 0x21c24 does not properly sanitize supplied input before interpolating it into a format string which gets passed to `popen()`. Consequently, an authenticated attacker is able to inject arbitrary OS commands and thus gain code execution on affected devices.</td>

					<td class=description>Codex CLI is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally. In versions 0.2.0 to 0.38.0, due to a bug in the sandbox configuration logic, Codex CLI could treat a model-generated cwd as the sandbox’s writable root, including paths outside of the folder where the user started their session. This logic bypassed the intended workspace boundary and enables arbitrary file writes and command execution where the Codex process has permissions - this did not impact the network-disabled sandbox restriction. This issue has been patched in Codex CLI 0.39.0 that canonicalizes and validates that the boundary used for sandbox policy is based on where the user started the session, and not the one generated by the model. Users running 0.38.0 or earlier should update immediately via their package manager or by reinstalling the latest Codex CLI to ensure sandbox boundaries are enforced. If using the Codex IDE extension, users should immediately update to 0.4.12 for a fix of the sandbox issue.</td>

The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6.</td>

					<td class=description>AiKaan Cloud Controller uses a single hardcoded SSH private key and the username `proxyuser` for remote terminal access to all managed IoT/edge devices. When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices.</td>
