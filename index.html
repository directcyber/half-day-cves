					<td class=description>A security flaw has been discovered in pymumu SmartDNS up to 47.1. This vulnerability affects the function _dns_decode_rr_head/_dns_decode_SVCB_HTTPS of the file src/dns.c of the component SVBC Record Parser. The manipulation results in stack-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. A high complexity level is associated with this attack. It is stated that the exploitability is difficult. The patch is identified as 2d57c4b4e1add9b4537aeb403f794a084727e1c8. Applying a patch is advised to resolve this issue.</td>

					<td class=description>Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions 0.9rc2 and below, avahi-daemon can be crashed via a segmentation fault by sending an unsolicited mDNS response containing a recursive CNAME record, where the alias and canonical name point to the same domain (e.g., "h.local" as a CNAME for "h.local"). This causes unbounded recursion in the lookup_handle_cname function, leading to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability affects record browsers where AVAHI_LOOKUP_USE_MULTICAST is set explicitly, which includes record browsers created by resolvers used by nss-mdns. This issue is patched in commit 78eab31128479f06e30beb8c1cbf99dd921e2524.</td>

The Decanter log socket collector exposes the port 4560, without authentication. If the collector exposes allowed classes property, this configuration can be bypassed.
It means that the log socket collector is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data, eventually causing DoS.


NB: Decanter log socket collector is not installed by default. Users who have not installed Decanter log socket are not impacted by this issue.

This issue affects Apache Karaf Decanter before 2.12.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.12.0, which fixes the issue.</td>
