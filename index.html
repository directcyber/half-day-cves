					<td class=description>Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. From Autolab versions v.3.0.0 onward students can download all assignments from another student, as long as they are logged in, using the download_all_submissions feature. This can allow for leakage of submissions to unauthorized users, such as downloading submissions from other students in the class, or even instructor test submissions, given they know their user IDs. This issue has been patched in commit `1aa4c769` which is not yet in a release version, but is expected to be included in version 3.0.3. Users are advised to either manually patch or to wait for version 3.0.3. As a workaround administrators can disable the feature.</td>

					<td class=description>E.D.D.I (Enhanced Dialog Driven Interface) is a middleware to connect and manage LLM API bots. A path traversal vulnerability exists in the backup export functionality of EDDI, as implemented in `RestExportService.java`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `botFilename` parameter in requests. The application fails to sanitize user input, enabling malicious inputs such as `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to access arbitrary files. However, the **severity of this vulnerability is significantly limited** because EDDI typically runs within a **Docker container**, which provides additional layers of isolation and restricted permissions. As a result, while this vulnerability exposes files within the container, it does not inherently threaten the underlying host system or other containers. A patch is required to sanitize and validate the botFilename input parameter. Users should ensure they are using version 5.4 which contains this patdch. For temporary mitigation, access to the vulnerable endpoint should be restricted through firewall rules or authentication mechanisms.</td>

					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: make keep-alive synchronous operation

The nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval,
could potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller.
This may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue
destroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx
queue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing
operation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below:

Call Trace:
    autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable)
    __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c
    blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84
    blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220
    nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core]
    process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0
    worker_thread+0x340/0x504
    kthread+0x138/0x140
    start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18

While shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks
in then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is
then invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which
decrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only
request in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero.
If that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_
queue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another
cpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward
progress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward
we are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the
issue here's that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue
dispatch operation hasn't yet finished its work and so it could still
potentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had
been already deleted and that causes the above crash.

This fix helps avoid the observed crash by implementing keep-alive as a
synchronous operation so that we decrement admin->q_usage_counter only
after keep-alive command finished its execution and returns the command
status back up to its caller (blk_execute_rq()). This would ensure that
fabric shutdown code path doesn't destroy the fabric admin queue until
keep-alive request finished execution and also keep-alive thread is not
running hw/hctx queue dispatch operation.</td>

					<td class=description>A NoSQL injection vulnerability in Adapt Learning Adapt Authoring Tool <= 0.11.3 allows unauthenticated attackers to reset user and administrator account passwords via the "Reset password" feature. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of user input, which is used as a query in Mongoose's find() function. This makes it possible for attackers to perform a full takeover of the administrator account. Attackers can then use the newly gained administrative privileges to upload a custom plugin to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the web application.</td>
