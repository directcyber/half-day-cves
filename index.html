Affected by this issue is the function get_split_entry of the file src/coap_oscore.c of the component Configuration File Handler. The manipulation leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-252206 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.</td>

					<td class=description>Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
and PKCS12_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.</td>

This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of ACLs on a stacked configuration when either the primary or backup switches experience a full stack reload or power cycle. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped or forwarded in an unexpected manner. The attacker does not have control over the conditions that result in the device being in the vulnerable state. Note: In the vulnerable state, the ACL would be correctly applied on the primary devices but could be incorrectly applied to the backup devices.</td>

					<td class=description>A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability combined with a Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information vulnerability in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to access sensitive system information.

When a user logs in, a temporary file which contains the configuration of the device (as visible to that user) is created in the /cache folder. An unauthenticated attacker can then attempt to access such a file by sending a specific request to the device trying to guess the name of such a file. Successful exploitation will reveal configuration information.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series:
