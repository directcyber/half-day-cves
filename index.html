					<td class=description>The kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.0 via the  `TH_PhpCode` pagebuilder widget. This is due to the theme not restricting access to the code editor widget for non-administrators. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.</td>

					<td class=date>2025-11-01T07:15:35.557</td>
					<td class=description>The RESTful Content Syndication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ingest_image() function in versions 1.1.0 to 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This requires the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings, so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin's settings.</td>

					<td class=description>The WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads when importing recipes via CSV in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0. This flaw allows an attacker with at least Contributor-level permissions to upload a malicious PHP file by providing a remote URL during a recipe import process, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).</td>

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible in configurations where unauthenticated users have been provided with a method for adding featured images, and the workflow trigger is created.</td>

					<td class=description>The Advanced Ads – Ad Manager & AdSense plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.12 via the select_one() function. This is due to the endpoint not properly restricting access to the AJAX endpoint or limiting the functions that can be called to safe functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call arbitrary functions beginning with get_the_ like get_the_excerpt which can make information exposure possible.</td>

					<td class=description>The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.14 via the action parameter in one of its shortcodes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.</td>

					<td class=description>A vulnerability was identified in LogicalDOC Community Edition up to 9.2.1. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /login.jsp of the component Admin Login Page. Such manipulation leads to improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts. The attack can be executed remotely. This attack is characterized by high complexity. It is stated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.</td>

					<td class=description>The OOPSpam Anti-Spam: Spam Protection for WordPress Forms & Comments (No CAPTCHA) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Header Spoofing in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.53. This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled forwarded headers (such as CF-Connecting-IP, X-Forwarded-For, and others) without verifying that those headers originate from legitimate, trusted proxies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address and bypass IP-based security controls, including blocked IP lists and rate limiting protections, by sending arbitrary HTTP headers with their requests.</td>

					<td class=description>The WordPress User Extra Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the save_fields() function in all versions up to, and including, 16.7.

					<td class=description>The Noo JobMonster theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.1. This is due to the check_login() function not properly verifying a user's identity prior to successfully authenticating them  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass standard authentication and access administrative user accounts.
