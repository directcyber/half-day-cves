An attacker who can authenticate locally (by knowing or guessing the password of a user) can thus log in regardless of MFA requirements. This does not affect MFA that are performed by single sign-on services. Users are advised to upgrade to at least version 5.1.9 to receive a fix.</td>

This issue affects Apache Superset: <4.1.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.0, which fixes the issue or add these Postgres functions to the config set DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS.</td>
