allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.

A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:

(<node>.)<fpc> Warning: jbuf pool id <#> utilization level (<current level>%) is above <threshold>%!

To recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.

					<td class=description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause an FPC to crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, in an EVPN-VXLAN scenario, when specific ARP packets are received on an IPv4 network, or specific NDP packets are received on an IPv6 network, kernel heap memory leaks, which eventually leads to an FPC crash and restart.

This issue does not affect MX Series platforms.
Heap size growth on FPC can be seen using below command.
