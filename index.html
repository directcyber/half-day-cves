					<td class=description>A vulnerability was detected in xerrors Yuxi-Know up to 0.4.0. This vulnerability affects the function OtherEmbedding.aencode of the file /src/models/embed.py. Performing manipulation of the argument health_url results in server-side request forgery. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit is now public and may be used. The patch is named 0ff771dc1933d5a6b78f804115e78a7d8625c3f3. To fix this issue, it is recommended to deploy a patch. The vendor responded with a vulnerability confirmation and a list of security measures they have established already (e.g. disabled URL parsing, disabled URL upload mode, removed URL-to-markdown conversion).</td>

					<td class=description>BACnet Protocol Stack library provides a BACnet application layer, network layer and media access (MAC) layer communications services. Prior to 1.5.0.rc2, The npdu_is_expected_reply function in src/bacnet/npdu.c indexes request_pdu[offset+2/3/5] and reply_pdu[offset+1/2/4] without verifying that those APDU bytes exist. bacnet_npdu_decode() can return offset == 2 for a 2-byte NPDU, so tiny PDUs pass the version check and then get read out of bounds. On ASan/MPU/strict builds this is an immediate crash (DoS). On unprotected builds it is undefined behavior and can mis-route replies; RCE is unlikely because only reads occur, but DoS is reliable.</td>

					<td class=description>Langflow versions up to and including 1.6.9 contain a chained vulnerability that enables account takeover and remote code execution. An overly permissive CORS configuration (allow_origins='*' with allow_credentials=True) combined with a refresh token cookie configured as SameSite=None allows a malicious webpage to perform cross-origin requests that include credentials and successfully call the refresh endpoint. An attacker-controlled origin can therefore obtain fresh access_token / refresh_token pairs for a victim session. Obtained tokens permit access to authenticated endpoints — including built-in code-execution functionality — allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code and achieve full system compromise.</td>

					<td class=description>A vulnerability exists in Google  Apigee's JavaCallout policy https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/java-callout-policy  that allows for remote code execution.

It is possible for a user to write a JavaCallout that injected a malicious object into the MessageContext to execute arbitrary Java code and system commands at runtime, leading to unauthorized access to data, lateral movement within the network, and access to backend systems.

The Apigee hybrid versions below have all been updated to protect from this vulnerability:
  *  Hybrid_1.11.2+
  *  Hybrid_1.12.4+
  *  Hybrid_1.13.3+
  *  Hybrid_1.14.1+
  *  OPDK_5202+

					<td class=description>cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior to 0.27.0, a vulnerability allows attacker-controlled HTTP headers to influence server-visible metadata, logging, and authorization decisions. An attacker can inject headers named REMOTE_ADDR, REMOTE_PORT, LOCAL_ADDR, LOCAL_PORT that are parsed into the request header multimap via read_headers() in httplib.h (headers.emplace), then the server later appends its own internal metadata using the same header names in Server::process_request without erasing duplicates. Because Request::get_header_value returns the first entry for a header key (id == 0) and the client-supplied headers are parsed before server-inserted headers, downstream code that uses these header names may inadvertently use attacker-controlled values. Affected files/locations: cpp-httplib/httplib.h (read_headers, Server::process_request, Request::get_header_value, get_header_value_u64) and cpp-httplib/docker/main.cc (get_client_ip, nginx_access_logger, nginx_error_logger). Attack surface: attacker-controlled HTTP headers in incoming requests flow into the Request.headers multimap and into logging code that reads forwarded headers, enabling IP spoofing, log poisoning, and authorization bypass via header shadowing. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.27.0.</td>
