This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with a non-required signature form field along with an image upload field. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

					<td class=description>The EM Beer Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload leading to remote code execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing file type validation in the EMBM_Admin_Untappd_Import_image() function and missing authorization checks on the wp_ajax_embm-untappd-import action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files including PHP files and execute code on the server granted they can provide a mock HTTP server that responds with specific JSON data.</td>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.</td>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to upload arbitrary plugin packages to the affected site's server via a crafted plugin URL, which may make remote code execution possible.</td>

Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file fuint-application/src/main/java/com/fuint/module/clientApi/controller/ClientSignController.java of the component Authentication Token Handler. Such manipulation leads to authorization bypass. The attack may be launched remotely. Attacks of this nature are highly complex. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. This product operates on a rolling release basis, ensuring continuous delivery. Consequently, there are no version details for either affected or updated releases.</td>
