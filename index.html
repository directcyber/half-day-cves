			<td class=date>2024-01-02T22:15:09.897</td>
			<td class=description>Rust EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter. In `rust-evm`, a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced, allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular, during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that the substack execution happens successfully, `rust-evm` will first commit the substate, and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available.</td>

			<td class=description>PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the `isCleanHTML` method. Some modules using the `isCleanHTML` method could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best workaround is to use the `HTMLPurifier` library to sanitize html input coming from users. The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML` type will call `isCleanHTML`.</td>
