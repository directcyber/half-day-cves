					<td class=description>Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.

The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression where the       rewritten URL was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the       possibility that, for rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the       URL, an attacker could manipulate the request URI to bypass security       constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are normally limited to trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI.



This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11 through 9.0.108.

The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are 
known to be affected: 8.5.6 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45 or later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the issue.</td>

User-controlled input is passed to PHP's unserialize(): the POST parameter `formkit_memory_recovery` in \\RoxPostHandler::getCallbackAction and the 'memory cookie' read by \\RoxModelBase::getMemoryCookie (bwRemember). (1) If present, `formkit_memory_recovery` is processed and passed to unserialize(), and (2) restore-from-memory functionality calls unserialize() on the bwRemember cookie value. Gadget chains present in Rox and bundled libraries enable exploitation of object injection to write arbitrary files or achieve remote code execution.

					<td class=description>The Product Filter by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'filtersDataBackend' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.7. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</td>

					<td class=description>The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to error‐based or time-based SQL Injection via the get_members() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 due to missing integer validation on the 'offset' and 'row_count' parameters. The function blindly interpolates 'row_count' into a 'LIMIT offset,row_count' clause using esc_sql() rather than enforcing numeric values. MySQL 5.x’s grammar allows a 'PROCEDURE ANALYSE' clause immediately after a LIMIT clause. Unauthenticated attackers controlling 'row_count' can append a stored‐procedure call, enabling error‐based or time‐based blind SQL injection that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</td>

					<td class=description>The Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file move due to insufficient file path validation in the add_listing_action AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.4.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).</td>

					<td class=description>The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check while verifying webhook signatures on the "verifyAndCreateOrderData" function  
in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass payment verification and mark orders as paid by submitting forged webhook requests with `payment_type` set to 'recurring'.</td>

					<td class=description>The eRoom – Webinar & Meeting Plugin for Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to exposure of sensitive information in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This is due to the plugin exposing Zoom SDK secret keys in client-side JavaScript within the meeting view template. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract the sdk_secret value, which should remain server-side, compromising the security of the Zoom integration and allowing attackers to generate valid JWT signatures for unauthorized meeting access.</td>
