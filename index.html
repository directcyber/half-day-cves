Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component RSA/OAuth2/Database. The manipulation results in hard-coded credentials. The attack can be executed remotely. The exploit has been made public and could be used. This product implements a rolling release for ongoing delivery, which means version information for affected or updated releases is unavailable.</td>

This is due to the plugin registering the `cg_check_wp_admin_upload_v10` AJAX action for both authenticated and unauthenticated users without implementing capability checks or nonce verification. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary WordPress media attachments into galleries and manipulate gallery metadata via the `cg_check_wp_admin_upload_v10` action. It does not enable an attacker to move or upload files.</td>
