					<td class=description>An issue in Raspberry Pi Imager version 1.9.6 for Windows, affecting its OS customization feature. The imager's 'public-key authentication' setting unintentionally re-adds a user's id_rsa.pub key from their local Windows machine to the authorized_keys file on the Raspberry Pi, even after the user explicitly deletes the key from the user interface. This creates an unintended attack surface, as it could allow an attacker to use a different key than the intended one to login to the device.</td>

This affects the function getImgUrl of the file WxActGoldeneggsPrizesController.java. Performing manipulation of the argument imgurl results in path traversal. Remote exploitation of the attack is possible. The exploit has been released to the public and may be exploited. This product follows a rolling release approach for continuous delivery, so version details for affected or updated releases are not provided. The root cause was initially fixed but can be evaded with additional encoding.</td>

Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file fuint-application/src/main/java/com/fuint/module/clientApi/controller/ClientSignController.java of the component Authentication Token Handler. Such manipulation leads to authorization bypass. The attack may be launched remotely. Attacks of this nature are highly complex. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. This product operates on a rolling release basis, ensuring continuous delivery.

This requires the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings, so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin's settings.</td>
