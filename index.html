					<td class=description>A vulnerability was determined in Tenda AC1206 15.03.06.23. Affected by this issue is the function formBehaviorManager of the file /goform/BehaviorManager of the component httpd. Executing a manipulation of the argument modulename/option/data/switch can lead to command injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been publicly disclosed and may be utilized.</td>

					<td class=description>MessagePack for Java is a serializer implementation for Java. A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.11 when deserializing .msgpack files containing EXT32 objects with attacker-controlled payload lengths. While MessagePack-Java parses extension headers lazily, it later trusts the declared EXT payload length when materializing the extension data. When ExtensionValue.getData() is invoked, the library attempts to allocate a byte array of the declared length without enforcing any upper bound. A malicious .msgpack file of only a few bytes can therefore trigger unbounded heap allocation, resulting in JVM heap exhaustion, process termination, or service unavailability. This vulnerability is triggered during model loading / deserialization, making it a model format vulnerability suitable for remote exploitation. The vulnerability enables a remote denial-of-service attack against applications that deserialize untrusted .msgpack model files using MessagePack for Java. A specially crafted but syntactically valid .msgpack file containing an EXT32 object with an attacker-controlled, excessively large payload length can trigger unbounded memory allocation during deserialization. When the model file is loaded, the library trusts the declared length metadata and attempts to allocate a byte array of that size, leading to rapid heap exhaustion, excessive garbage collection, or immediate JVM termination with an OutOfMemoryError. The attack requires no malformed bytes, user interaction, or elevated privileges and can be exploited remotely in real-world environments such as model registries, inference services, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-based model hosting platforms that accept or fetch .msgpack artifacts. Because the malicious file is extremely small yet valid, it can bypass basic validation and scanning mechanisms, resulting in complete service unavailability and potential cascading failures in production systems. Version 0.9.11 fixes the vulnerability.</td>

					<td class=description>Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto prior to version 2.3.10 within the CMS page editor. Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize `<script>` tags, the filtering can be bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST request before submission. As a result, arbitrary JavaScript can be stored in the CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited. This exposes administrators to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover, backend hijacking, and malicious script execution. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.</td>

					<td class=description>Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. In versions on the 2.3 branch prior to 2.3.10, API routes remain active even after initial installation is complete. The underlying API endpoints (`/install/api/*`) are directly accessible and exploitable without any authentication. An attacker can bypass the Ib installer entirely by calling the API endpoints directly. This allows any unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts, modify application configurations, and potentially overwrite existing data. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.</td>

This affects endpoints handling personal data and system operations that should require proper authorization. Version 1.7.0.dev45 contains a patch.</td>
