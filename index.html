Atlassian recommends that Sourcetree for Mac and Sourcetree for Windows customers upgrade to latest version, if you are unable to do so, upgrade your instance to one of the specified supported fixed versions:
 Sourcetree for Mac 4.2: Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 4.2.9
 Sourcetree for Windows 3.4: Upgrade to a release greater than or equal to 3.4.20

See the release notes ([https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download-archives]). You can download the latest version of Sourcetree for Mac and Sourcetree for Windows from the download center ([https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download-archives]).

Reproducer uses faultinject facility to fail ocfs2_xa_remove() ->
ocfs2_xa_value_truncate() with -ENOMEM.

In this case the comment mentions that we can return 0 if
ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate() is going to wipe the entry
anyway. But the following 'rc' check is wrong and execution flow do
'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:
* 1st: in ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate();
* 2nd: returning back to ocfs2_xa_remove() instead of going to 'out'.

Fix this by skipping the 2nd removal of the same entry and making
syzkaller repro happy.</td>

However, due to the current execution order of pre-steps in GitHub Actions and the placement of harden-runner as the first step in a job, the likelihood of exploitation is low as the Harden-Runner action reads the environment variable during the pre-step stage. There are no known exploits at this time. Version 2.10.2 contains a patch.</td>

					<td class=description>OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.</td>
