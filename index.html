					<td class=description>An issue was discovered in matio 1.5.28. A heap-based memory corruption can occur in Mat_VarCreateStruct() when the nfields value does not match the actual number of strings in the fields array. This leads to out-of-bounds reads and invalid memory frees during cleanup, potentially causing a segmentation fault or heap corruption.</td>

Starting in version 4.29.0 and prior to version 4.29.3, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Serverless Framework's built-in MCP server package (@serverless/mcp). This vulnerability only affects users of the experimental MCP server feature (serverless mcp), which represents less than 0.1% of Serverless Framework users. The core Serverless Framework CLI and deployment functionality are not affected. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Version 4.29.3 fixes the issue.</td>

					<td class=description>coturn is a free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Versions 4.6.2r5 through 4.7.0-r4 have a bad random number generator for nonces and port randomization after refactoring. Additionally, random numbers aren't generated with openssl's RAND_bytes but libc's random() (if it's not running on Windows). When fetching about 50 sequential nonces (i.e., through sending 50 unauthenticated allocations requests) it is possible to completely reconstruct the current state of the random number generator, thereby predicting the next nonce. This allows authentication while spoofing IPs. An attacker can send authenticated messages without ever receiving the responses, including the nonce (requires knowledge of the credentials, which is e.g., often the case in IoT settings). Since the port randomization is deterministic given the pseudorandom seed, an attacker can exactly reconstruct the ports and, hence predict the randomization of the ports. If an attacker allocates a relay port, they know the current port, and they are able to predict the next relay port (at least if it is not used before). Commit 11fc465f4bba70bb0ad8aae17d6c4a63a29917d9 contains a fix.</td>

					<td class=description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in qs (parse modules) allows HTTP DoS.This issue affects qs: < 6.14.1.


SummaryThe arrayLimit option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. Applications using arrayLimit for DoS protection are vulnerable.

DetailsThe arrayLimit option only checks limits for indexed notation (a[0]=1&a[1]=2) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2).

Vulnerable code (lib/parse.js:159-162):

if (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {
    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check
}





Working code (lib/parse.js:175):

else if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here
    obj = [];
    obj[index] = leaf;
}





The bracket notation handler at line 159 uses utils.combine([], leaf) without validating against options.arrayLimit, while indexed notation at line 175 checks index <= options.arrayLimit before creating arrays.

PoCTest 1 - Basic bypass:

npm install qs





const qs = require('qs');
const result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });
console.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)





Test 2 - DoS demonstration:

const qs = require('qs');
const attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');
const result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });
console.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)





Configuration:

  *  arrayLimit: 5 (test 1) or arrayLimit: 100 (test 2)
  *  Use bracket notation: a[]=value (not indexed a[0]=value)


ImpactDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using qs.parse() with user-controlled input and arrayLimit for protection.

Attack scenario:

  *  Attacker sends HTTP request: GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x (100,000+ times)
  *  Application parses with qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })
  *  qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array
  *  Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive
  *  Service unavailable for all users
Real-world impact:

  *  Single malicious request can crash server
  *  No authentication required
  *  Easy to automate and scale
  *  Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation</td>

					<td class=description>Axios Cache Interceptor is a cache interceptor for axios. Prior to version 1.11.1, when a server calls an upstream service using different auth tokens, axios-cache-interceptor returns incorrect cached responses, leading to authorization bypass. The cache key is generated only from the URL, ignoring request headers like `Authorization`. When the server responds with `Vary: Authorization` (indicating the response varies by auth token), the library ignores this, causing all requests to share the same cache regardless of authorization. Server-side applications (APIs, proxies, backend services) that use axios-cache-interceptor to cache requests to upstream services, handle requests from multiple users with different auth tokens, and upstream services replies on `Vary` to differentiate caches are affected. Browser/client-side applications (single user per browser session) are not affected. Services using different auth tokens to call upstream services will return incorrect cached data, bypassing authorization checks and leaking user data across different authenticated sessions. After `v1.11.1`, automatic `Vary` header support is now enabled by default. When server responds with `Vary: Authorization`, cache keys now include the authorization header value. Each user gets their own cache.</td>

					<td class=description>Nest is a framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. Versions prior to 11.1.11 have a Fastify URL encoding middleware bypass. A NestJS application is vulnerable if it uses `@nestjs/platform-fastify`; relies on `NestMiddleware` (via `MiddlewareConsumer`) for security checks (authentication, authorization, etc.), or through `app.use()`; and applies middleware to specific routes using string paths or controllers (e.g., `.forRoutes('admin')`). Exploitation can result in unauthenticated users accessing protected routes, restricted administrative endpoints becoming accessible to lower-privileged users, and/or middleware performing sanitization or validation being skipped. This issue is patched in `@nestjs/platform-fastify@11.1.11`.</td>

					<td class=description>phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. In versions prior to 4.0.16, an unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger generation of a configuration backup ZIP via `POST /api/setup/backup` and then download the generated ZIP from a web-accessible location. The ZIP contains sensitive configuration files (e.g., `database.php` with database credentials), leading to high-impact information disclosure and potential follow-on compromise. Version 4.0.16 fixes the issue.</td>

					<td class=description>DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 201206030 novel V3.5.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code or disclose sensitive information (e.g., user session cookies) via a crafted "wvstest" parameter in the URL or malicious script injection into window.localStorage. The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation and encoding of user-controllable data in the book comment module: unfiltered user input is stored in the backend database (book_comment table, commentContent field) and returned via API, then rendered directly into the page DOM via Vue 3's v-html directive without sanitization. Even if modern browsers' built-in XSS filters block pop-up alerts, attackers can use concealed payloads to bypass interception and achieve actual harm.</td>
