					<td class=description>A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms application, affecting version 9.4.0 and potentially earlier versions, but fixed in version 5.9.0. The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of file paths between Windows and Linux environments, allowing attackers to traverse beyond the intended directory and read any file on the Windows system. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize file paths containing backslashes (`\`), which can be exploited to access the root directory and read, or even delete, sensitive files. This issue was discovered in the context of the `/user_infos` endpoint, where a crafted request using backslashes to reference a file (e.g., `\windows\win.ini`) could result in unauthorized file access. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for attackers to access sensitive information such as environment variables, database files, and configuration files, which could lead to further compromise of the system.</td>

					<td class=description>In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists in the thread update process that allows users with Default or Manager roles to escalate their privileges to Administrator. The issue arises from improper input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the endpoint `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`. Specifically, the application fails to validate or check user input before passing it to the `workspace_thread` Prisma model for execution. This oversight allows attackers to craft a Prisma relation query operation that manipulates the `users` model to change a user's role to admin. Successful exploitation grants attackers the highest level of user privileges, enabling them to see and perform all actions within the system.</td>

This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles, processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs which may contain sensitive information.</td>

					<td class=description>A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application, affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs, which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that, when clicked by the admin, send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges to admin, or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click, or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers, by directly clicking on the link.</td>

Once the password is known, attackers can conduct blind attacks to ascertain the full username, significantly compromising system security.</td>

The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations.

The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names.</td>

The framework, which is used in distributed training scenarios, does not properly verify the functions being called during RPC (Remote Procedure Call) operations. This oversight permits attackers to execute arbitrary commands by leveraging built-in Python functions such as eval during multi-cpu RPC communication. The vulnerability arises from the lack of restriction on function calls when a worker node serializes and sends a PythonUDF (User Defined Function) to the master node, which then deserializes and executes the function without validation. This flaw can be exploited to compromise master nodes initiating distributed training, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive AI-related data.</td>
