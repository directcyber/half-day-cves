					<td class=description>Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. An HTTP/2 SSL connection that is established and TCP congested will be leaked when it times out. An attacker can cause many connections to end up in this state, and the server may run out of file descriptors, eventually causing the server to stop accepting new connections from valid clients. The vulnerability is patched in 9.4.54, 10.0.20, 11.0.20, and 12.0.6.

which is a special IP and URL that resolves only when the request comes from within an EC2 instance. This would allow the user to see the connection/secret credentials for their specific instance and be able to manage it regardless of who deployed it.

The user would have to have pre-existing knowledge of the hosting infra which the target instance is deployed on, but if sent - would resolve if on EC2 and the proper `iptable` or firewall rule is not configured for their setup.</td>

While this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level.</td>

Given the minimum requirement for a user to send a chat is to be given access to a workspace via an admin the risk is low. Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. 

Ultimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance.</td>
