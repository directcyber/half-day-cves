Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. This issue is a follow-up to CVE-2024-39887 with additional disallowed PostgreSQL functions now included: query_to_xml_and_xmlschema, table_to_xml, table_to_xml_and_xmlschema.

This issue affects Apache Superset: <4.1.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.0, which fixes the issue or add these Postgres functions to the config set DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS.</td>
