					<td class=description>I have activated the CORS because I had a development ui that uses another port number then I forgot to remove it.

So what I just did is :
- First removed the cors configuration that allows everyone to access it :
before:
```python
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins="*", ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for every one
```
after:
```python
    cert_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"cert.pem"
    key_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"key.pem"
    if os.path.exists(cert_file_path) and os.path.exists(key_file_path):
        is_https = True
    else:
        is_https = False        

    # Create a Socket.IO server
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins=config.allowed_origins+[f"https://localhost:{config['port']}" if is_https else f"http://localhost:{config['port']}"], ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for selected origins
```

- Second, I have updated lollms to have two modes (a headless mode and a ui mode).
And updated the /execute_code to block if the server is headless or is exposed
```python
@router.post("/execute_code")
async def execute_code(request: Request):
    """
    Executes Python code and returns the output.

    :param request: The HTTP request object.
    :return: A JSON response with the status of the operation.
    """
    if lollmsElfServer.config.headless_server_mode:
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when in headless mode for obvious security reasons!"}

    if lollmsElfServer.config.host=="0.0.0.0":
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when the server is exposed outside for very obvipous reasons!"}

    try:

        return {"status": False, "error": "Unsupported language", "execution_time": 0}
    except Exception as ex:
        trace_exception(ex)
        lollmsElfServer.error(ex)
        return {"status":False,"error":str(ex)}
```

I also added an optional https mode and looking forward to add a full authentication with cookies and a personal session etc.


All updates will be in V 9.1 


Again, thanks alot for your work. I will make it harder next time, but if you find more bugs, just be my guest :)</td>

					<td class=description>The ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.6 via the render_raw function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.</td>
