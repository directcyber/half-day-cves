					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload

When a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the
underlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the
associated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack
then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for
this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the
'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the
classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a
'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.

However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the
underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when
a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be
reproduced using [2].

Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack
invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.
Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain
templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'
command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a
filter block or being unbound from one.

As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which
reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()
in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block
is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.

					<td class=description>Centreon updateLCARelation SQL Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Centreon. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the updateLCARelation function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-22296.</td>

					<td class=description>I have activated the CORS because I had a development ui that uses another port number then I forgot to remove it.

So what I just did is :
- First removed the cors configuration that allows everyone to access it :
before:
```python
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins="*", ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for every one
```
after:
```python
    cert_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"cert.pem"
    key_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/"key.pem"
    if os.path.exists(cert_file_path) and os.path.exists(key_file_path):
        is_https = True
    else:
        is_https = False        

    # Create a Socket.IO server
    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode="asgi", cors_allowed_origins=config.allowed_origins+[f"https://localhost:{config['port']}" if is_https else f"http://localhost:{config['port']}"], ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for selected origins
```

- Second, I have updated lollms to have two modes (a headless mode and a ui mode).
And updated the /execute_code to block if the server is headless or is exposed
```python
@router.post("/execute_code")
async def execute_code(request: Request):
    """
    Executes Python code and returns the output.

    :param request: The HTTP request object.
    :return: A JSON response with the status of the operation.
    """
    if lollmsElfServer.config.headless_server_mode:
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when in headless mode for obvious security reasons!"}

    if lollmsElfServer.config.host=="0.0.0.0":
        return {"status":False,"error":"Code execution is blocked when the server is exposed outside for very obvipous reasons!"}

    try:
        data = (await request.json())
        code = data["code"]
        discussion_id = int(data.get("discussion_id","unknown_discussion"))
        message_id = int(data.get("message_id","unknown_message"))
        language = data.get("language","python")
        


        if language=="python":
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing python code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_python(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        if language=="javascript":
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing javascript code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_javascript(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        if language in ["html","html5","svg"]:
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing javascript code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_html(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        
        elif language=="latex":
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing latex code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_latex(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        elif language in ["bash","shell","cmd","powershell"]:
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing shell code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_bash(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        elif language in ["mermaid"]:
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing mermaid code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_mermaid(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        elif language in ["graphviz","dot"]:
            ASCIIColors.info("Executing graphviz code:")
            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)
            return execute_graphviz(code, discussion_id, message_id)
        return {"status": False, "error": "Unsupported language", "execution_time": 0}
    except Exception as ex:
        trace_exception(ex)
        lollmsElfServer.error(ex)
        return {"status":False,"error":str(ex)}
```

I also added an optional https mode and looking forward to add a full authentication with cookies and a personal session etc.


All updates will be in V 9.1 


Again, thanks alot for your work. I will make it harder next time, but if you find more bugs, just be my guest :)</td>
