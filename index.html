Affected by this vulnerability is the function GPTSeleniumAgent of the file browserpilot/browserpilot/agents/gpt_selenium_agent.py. The manipulation of the argument instructions leads to code injection. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.</td>

Prior to version 1.0.0, a critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script of the LLaMA-Factory project. The script performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied `.bin` files from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a malicious `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.0.</td>

NOTE: this is not a problem in the Node.js software itself. In particular, the Node.js website's download page does not offer prebuilt Node.js for Linux on i386.</td>

Fixed in:

 

 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 


Impact: 

PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.</td>

					<td class=description>The OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.

Fixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 

Impact:

 

Under certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.

In order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.

Note: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.</td>

perf: Fix hang while freeing sigtrap event

Perf can hang while freeing a sigtrap event if a related deferred
signal hadn't managed to be sent before the file got closed:

perf_event_overflow()
   task_work_add(perf_pending_task)

fput()
   task_work_add(____fput())

task_work_run()
    ____fput()
        perf_release()
            perf_event_release_kernel()
                _free_event()
                    perf_pending_task_sync()
                        task_work_cancel() -> FAILED
                        rcuwait_wait_event()

Once task_work_run() is running, the list of pending callbacks is
removed from the task_struct and from this point on task_work_cancel()
can't remove any pending and not yet started work items, hence the
task_work_cancel() failure and the hang on rcuwait_wait_event().

Task work could be changed to remove one work at a time, so a work
running on the current task can always cancel a pending one, however
the wait / wake design is still subject to inverted dependencies when
remote targets are involved, as pictured by Oleg:

T1                                                      T2

fd = perf_event_open(pid => T2->pid);                  fd = perf_event_open(pid => T1->pid);
close(fd)                                              close(fd)
    <IRQ>                                                  <IRQ>
    perf_event_overflow()                                  perf_event_overflow()
       task_work_add(perf_pending_task)                        task_work_add(perf_pending_task)
    </IRQ>                                                 </IRQ>
    fput()                                                 fput()
        task_work_add(____fput())                              task_work_add(____fput())

    task_work_run()                                        task_work_run()
        ____fput()                                             ____fput()
            perf_release()                                         perf_release()
                perf_event_release_kernel()                            perf_event_release_kernel()
                    _free_event()                                          _free_event()
                        perf_pending_task_sync()                               perf_pending_task_sync()
                            rcuwait_wait_event()                                   rcuwait_wait_event()

Therefore the only option left is to acquire the event reference count
upon queueing the perf task work and release it from the task work, just
like it was done before 3a5465418f5f ("perf: Fix event leak upon exec and file release")
but without the leaks it fixed.

Some adjustments are necessary to make it work:

* A child event might dereference its parent upon freeing. Care must be
  taken to release the parent last.

* Some places assuming the event doesn't have any reference held and
  therefore can be freed right away must instead put the reference and
  let the reference counting to its job.</td>
