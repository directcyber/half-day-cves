					<td class=description>Within tcpreplay's tcprewrite, a double free vulnerability has been identified in the dlt_linuxsll2_cleanup() function in plugins/dlt_linuxsll2/linuxsll2.c. This vulnerability is triggered when tcpedit_dlt_cleanup() indirectly invokes the cleanup routine multiple times on the same memory region. By supplying a specifically crafted pcap file to the tcprewrite binary, a local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via memory corruption.</td>

					<td class=description>AiKaan Cloud Controller uses a single hardcoded SSH private key and the username `proxyuser` for remote terminal access to all managed IoT/edge devices. When an administrator initiates "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices.</td>

Separately, commented-out code in /var/www/app/lib/common/oses.php would unserialize session data (unserialize($_SESSION['osdata']))—a pattern that can enable remote code execution if re-enabled or reached with attacker-controlled serialized data.

In multiple places, the application sets libcurl/PHP transport options such that CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER are effectively disabled, and environment variables (for example API_*_VERIFYSSL=false) are used to turn off verification for gateway and microservice endpoints. As a result, the client accepts TLS connections without validating server certificates (and, in some cases, uses clear-text HTTP), permitting on-path attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker able to intercept network traffic between the product and printers or microservices can eavesdrop on and modify sensitive data (including print jobs, configuration, and authentication tokens), inject malicious payloads, or disrupt service.</td>

The PrinterInstallerClient driver-installation component launches programs using an unquoted path under "C:\Program Files (x86)\Printer Properties Pro\Printer Installer". Because the path is unquoted, the operating system may execute a program located at a short-path location such as C:\Program.exe before the intended binaries in the quoted path. If an attacker can place or cause a program to exist at that location, it will be executed with the privileges of the installer process (which may be elevated), enabling arbitrary code execution and potential privilege escalation. This weakness can be used to achieve remote code execution and full compromise of affected Windows endpoints.</td>

These binaries are built as 32-bit, without Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Control Flow Guard (CFG), or stack-protection, and they incorporate legacy technologies (Pascal/Delphi and Python 2) which are no longer commonly maintained. Several of these processes run with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for PrinterInstallerClient.exe and PrinterInstallerClientLauncher.exe), and the client automatically downloads and installs printer drivers. The absence of modern memory safety mitigations and the use of unmaintained runtimes substantially increase the risk that memory-corruption or other exploit primitives — for example from crafted driver content or maliciously crafted inputs — can be turned into remote or local code execution and privilege escalation to SYSTEM.</td>

					<td class=description>Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (macOS/Linux client deployments) are vulnerable to an authentication bypass in PrinterInstallerClientService. The service requires root privileges for certain administrative operations, but these checks rely on calls to geteuid(). By preloading a malicious shared object overriding geteuid(), a local attacker can trick the service into believing it is running with root privileges. This bypass enables execution of administrative commands (e.g., enabling debug mode, managing configurations, or invoking privileged features) without proper authorization. While some actions requiring write access to protected files may still fail, the flaw effectively breaks the intended security model of the inter-process communication (IPC) system, allowing local attackers to escalate privileges and compromise system integrity. NOTE: This vulnerability has been addressed, but an affected version range is not yet fully determined. We will update this record as soon as the vendor provides confirmed version information.</td>

					<td class=description>Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735 and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (macOS/Linux client deployments) contain a vulnerability in the local logging mechanism. Authentication session tokens, including PHPSESSID, XSRF-TOKEN, and laravel_session, are stored in cleartext within world-readable log files. Any local user with access to the machine can extract these session tokens and use them to authenticate remotely to the SaaS environment, bypassing normal login credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized system access and exposure of sensitive information.</td>
