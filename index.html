					<td class=description>Livemarks is a browser extension that provides RSS feed bookmark folders. Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`.

					<td class=description>gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The `/api/config` endpoint allows one to modify the existing configuration with user-supplied values. While the API is only allowing localhost to interact without authentication, an attacker may be able to achieve that depending on how go2rtc is set up on the upstream application, and given that this endpoint is not protected against CSRF, it allows requests from any origin (e.g. a "drive-by" attack) . The `exec` handler allows for any stream to execute arbitrary commands. An attacker may add a custom stream through `api/config`, which may lead to arbitrary command execution. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the requests against the go2rtc instance. Commit 8793c3636493c5efdda08f3b5ed5c6e1ea594fd9 adds a warning about secure API access.</td>

					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload

When a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the
underlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the
associated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack
then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for
this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the
'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the
classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a
'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.

However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the
underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when
a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be
reproduced using [2].

Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack
invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.
Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain
templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'
command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a
filter block or being unbound from one.

As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which
reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()
in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block
is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.
