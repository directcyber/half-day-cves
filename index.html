					<td class=description>There exists an auth bypass in Google Quickshare where an attacker can upload an unknown file type to a victim. The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that when a Payload Transfer frame of type FILE is sent to Quick Share, the file that is contained in this frame is written to disk in the Downloads folder. Quickshare normally deletes unkown files, however an attacker can send two Payload transfer frames of type FILE and the same payload ID. The deletion logic will only delete the first file and not the second. We recommend upgrading past commit 5d8b9156e0c339d82d3dab0849187e8819ad92c0 or Quick Share Windows v1.0.2002.2</td>

					<td class=description>When using IPAuthenticationProvider in ZooKeeper Admin Server there is a possibility of Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -- this only impacts IP based authentication implemented in ZooKeeper Admin Server. Default configuration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider, which uses HTTP request headers, is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers. Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands, such as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successful exploitation which could potentially lead to information leakage or service availability issues. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.3, which fixes this issue.</td>

					<td class=description>The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin – Super Socializer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 7.13.68. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 7.13.68.</td>

					<td class=description>The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads due to a missing capability check in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain access to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the .exe file.</td>
