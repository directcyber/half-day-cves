sched/numa: fix memory leak due to the overwritten vma->numab_state

[Problem Description]
When running the hackbench program of LTP, the following memory leak is
reported by kmemleak.

  # /opt/ltp/testcases/bin/hackbench 20 thread 1000
  Running with 20*40 (== 800) tasks.

  # dmesg | grep kmemleak
  ...
  kmemleak: 480 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak)
  kmemleak: 665 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak)

  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak

      [<ffffffff81e0012b>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e
  ...

This issue can be consistently reproduced on three different servers:
  * a 448-core server
  * a 256-core server
  * a 192-core server

[Root Cause]
Since multiple threads are created by the hackbench program (along with
the command argument 'thread'), a shared vma might be accessed by two or
more cores simultaneously. When two or more cores observe that
vma->numab_state is NULL at the same time, vma->numab_state will be
overwritten.

Although current code ensures that only one thread scans the VMAs in a
single 'numa_scan_period', there might be a chance for another thread
to enter in the next 'numa_scan_period' while we have not gotten till
numab_state allocation [1].

Note that the command `/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/hackbench 50 process 1000`
cannot the reproduce the issue. It is verified with 200+ test runs.

[Solution]
Use the cmpxchg atomic operation to ensure that only one thread executes
the vma->numab_state assignment.

This is caused by lost memory during early init phase. First time driver
is removed, memory is freed but when second time the driver is inserted,
VBIOS dmub is not active, since the PSP policy is to retain the driver
loaded version on subsequent warm boots. Hence, communication with VBIOS
DMUB fails.

Fix this by aborting further comm
