					<td class=description>ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239.</td>

					<td class=description>ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. During the user avatar upload workflow, a user can choose to upload and change their avatar at any time. During deletion, ClipBucket checks for the avatar_url as a filepath within the avatars subdirectory. If the URL path exists within the avatars directory, ClipBucket will delete it. There is no check for path traversal sequences in the provided user input (stored in the DB as avatar_url) therefore the final $file variable could be tainted with path traversal sequences. This leads to file deletion outside of the intended scope of the avatars folder. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 237.</td>

					<td class=description>An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved's routing protocol daemon (rpd) allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to send malformed BGP packets to a device configured with packet receive trace options enabled to crash rpd.
This issue affects:

Junos OS: 



  *  from 21.2R3-S8 before 21.2R3-S9, 
  *  from 21.4R3-S7 before 21.4R3-S9,

  *  from 23.2R2 before 23.2R2-S2, 
  *  from 23.4R1 before 23.4R2-S1, 
  *  from 24.2R1 before 24.2R1-S1, 24.2R2.


Junos OS Evolved:
  *  from 21.4R3-S7-EVO before 21.4R3-S9-EVO, 
  *  from 22.2R3-S4-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO, 
  *  from 22.3R3-S2-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,

  *  from 24.2R1-EVO before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.


This issue requires a BGP session to be established.

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:
  rpd[<pid>]: Received malformed update from <IP address> (External AS <AS#>)
and
  rpd[<pid>]: Malformed Attribute</td>

However, repeated execution of this command will eventually cause the chassisd process to fail to restart, impacting packet processing on the system.

Through the execution of either 'show services advanced-anti-malware' or 'show services security-intelligence' command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low privilege login class user) can access protected files that should not be accessible to the user. These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system.
