					<td class=description>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.

A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.</td>

					<td class=description>A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager (NetkworkManager-libreswan), where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine.</td>

					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes "System RAM (kmem)" a descendant of "CXL
Window X".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all "System
RAM" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be "Operation not permitted" instead of "Bad address".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff
 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 416 at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:216 __ioremap_caller.constprop.0+0x131/0x35d
 Call Trace:
  memremap+0xcb/0x184
  xlate_dev_mem_ptr+0x25/0x2f
  write_mem+0x94/0xfb
  vfs_write+0x128/0x26d
  ksys_write+0xac/0xfe
  do_syscall_64+0x9a/0xfd
  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, "System RAM" is a descendant of "CXL Window 0" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with "System RAM" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- "CXL Window 0" ------------|
|-- "System RAM" --|

will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for
region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

|-- "System RAM" --||-- "CXL Window 0a" --|

Where "CXL Window 0a" is part of the original "CXL Window 0" that
isn't covered by "System RAM".</td>

tpm_dev_transmit prepares the TPM space before attempting command
transmission. However if the command fails no rollback of this

if the device is subsequently closed with no further commands performed.

failure.</td>
