					<td class=description>Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on a network. Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for this issue.</td>

Starting in version 2023.12.9 and prior to version 2024.2.2, editing the configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation and Home Assistant add-on) serves unsanitized data with `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`, allowing a remote authenticated user to inject arbitrary web script and exfiltrate session cookies via Cross-Site scripting. It is possible for a malicious authenticated user to inject arbitrary Javascript in configuration files using a POST request to the /edit endpoint, the configuration parameter allows to specify the file to write. To trigger the XSS vulnerability, the victim must visit the page` /edit?configuration=[xss file]`. Abusing this vulnerability a malicious actor could perform operations on the dashboard on the behalf of a logged user, access sensitive information, create, edit and delete configuration files and flash firmware on managed boards.
In addition to this, cookies are not correctly secured, allowing the exfiltration of session cookie values. Version 2024.2.2 contains a patch for this issue.
