ocfs2: remove entry once instead of null-ptr-dereference in ocfs2_xa_remove()

Reproducer uses faultinject facility to fail ocfs2_xa_remove() ->
ocfs2_xa_value_truncate() with -ENOMEM.

In this case the comment mentions that we can return 0 if
ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate() is going to wipe the entry
anyway. But the following 'rc' check is wrong and execution flow do
'ocfs2_xa_remove_entry(loc);' twice:
* 1st: in ocfs2_xa_cleanup_value_truncate();
* 2nd: returning back to ocfs2_xa_remove() instead of going to 'out'.

Fix this by skipping the 2nd removal of the same entry and making
syzkaller repro happy.</td>

Versions of step-security/harden-runner prior to v2.10.2 contain multiple command injection weaknesses via environment variables that could potentially be exploited under specific conditions. However, due to the current execution order of pre-steps in GitHub Actions and the placement of harden-runner as the first step in a job, the likelihood of exploitation is low as the Harden-Runner action reads the environment variable during the pre-step stage. There are no known exploits at this time. Version 2.10.2 contains a patch.</td>

The risk of this issue is greatly reduced if you secure access to the management web interface by restricting access to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommendedÂ  best practice deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

This issue is applicable only to PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, PAN-OS 11.1, and PAN-OS 11.2 software.

Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access are not impacted by this vulnerability.</td>

					<td class=description>OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.</td>
