This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity and potentially the availability of the database. 





Version 5.7.139

 has been confirmed as vulnerable. Other versions have not been confirmed by the vendor and users should assume that all versions of BEIMS Contractor Web may be impacted until further guidance is provided by the vendor.</td>
