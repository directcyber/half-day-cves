					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work

The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(),
which does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel->dprx_work has
fully completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free
scenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while
tunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel
in tb_dp_dprx_work().

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0                            | CPU 1
tb_dp_tunnel_active()            |
  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()
    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()
      tb_dp_activate()           |
        tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker
          cancel_delayed_work()  |
    tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |
                                 |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF
                                 |   tunnel-> //UAF

Replacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is
not feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()
and the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()
would wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.

Instead, implement proper reference counting:
- If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release
  the reference in the stop function.
- If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the
  reference is released in delayed work function itself.

This ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution
while preventing memory leaks.

This bug was found by static analysis.</td>

The vulnerable code is located in pyquokka/flight.py at line 283 where arbitrary data from Flight clients is directly passed to pickle.loads(). When FlightServer is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0, this allows attackers across the entire network to perform arbitrary remote code execution by sending malicious pickled payloads through the set_configs action. Additional vulnerability points exist in the cache_garbage_collect, do_put, and do_get functions where pickle.loads is used to deserialize untrusted remote data.</td>
