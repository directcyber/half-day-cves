The backend does not verify role-based permissions for analytics endpoints, allowing unauthorized retrieval of station-wide metrics. This results in information disclosure to less privileged users.</td>

					<td class=description>Bambu Studio 2.1.1.52 and earlier is affected by a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution during application startup. The application loads a network plugin without validating its digital signature or verifying its authenticity. A local attacker can exploit this behavior by placing a malicious component in the expected location, which is controllable by the attacker (e.g., under %APPDATA%), resulting in code execution within the context of the user. The main application is digitally signed, which may allow a malicious component to inherit trust and evade detection by security solutions that rely on signed parent processes.</td>

This includes monitored screenshots and keystrokes of all users.

The WorkExaminer Professional console is used for administrative access to the server. Before access to the console is granted administrators must login. Internally, a custom protocol is used to call a respective stored procedure on the MSSQL database. The return value of the call is not validated on the server-side. Instead it is only validated client-side which allows to bypass authentication.</td>
