					<td class=description>The Kyber reference implementation before 9b8d306, when compiled by LLVM Clang through 18.x with some common optimization options, has a timing side channel that allows attackers to recover an ML-KEM 512 secret key in minutes. This occurs because poly_frommsg in poly.c does not prevent Clang from emitting a vulnerable secret-dependent branch.</td>

					<td class=description>An issue was discovered on Mitel 6869i through 4.5.0.41 and 5.x through 5.0.0.1018 devices. A command injection vulnerability exists in the hostname parameter taken in by the provis.html endpoint. The provis.html endpoint performs no sanitization on the hostname parameter (sent by an authenticated user), which is subsequently written to disk. During boot, the hostname parameter is executed as part of a series of shell commands. Attackers can achieve remote code execution in the root context by placing shell metacharacters in the hostname parameter.</td>

This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /labvantage/rc?command=page&page=SampleList&_iframename=list of the component POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument param1 leads to sql injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-267454 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.</td>

					<td class=description>GStreamer AV1 Video Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of tile list data within AV1-encoded video files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22873.</td>

					<td class=description>Invision Community through 4.7.16 allows remote code execution via the applications/core/modules/admin/editor/toolbar.php IPS\core\modules\admin\editor\_toolbar::addPlugin() method. This method handles uploaded ZIP files that are extracted into the applications/core/interface/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/ directory without properly verifying their content. This can be exploited by admin users (with the toolbar_manage permission) to write arbitrary PHP files into that directory, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code in the context of the web server user.</td>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. Please note that this requires an attacker to create a non-existent directory or target an instance where file_exists won't return false with a non-existent directory in the path, in order to successfully exploit.</td>
