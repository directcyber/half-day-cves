					<td class=description>vodozemac is an implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust. Versions 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 of vodozemac have degraded secret zeroization capabilities, due to changes in third-party cryptographic dependencies (the Dalek crates), which moved secret zeroization capabilities behind a feature flag and defaulted this feature to off. The degraded zeroization capabilities could result in the production of more memory copies of encryption secrets and secrets could linger in memory longer than necessary. This marginally increases the risk of sensitive data exposure. This issue has been addressed in version 0.6.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added

Commit 09ed8bfc5215 ("wilc1000: Rename workqueue from "WILC_wq" to
"NETDEV-wq"") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to
set the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver
needs only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we
add an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a
new one. This can be observed with the following commands:

for i in $(seq 0 10)
do
  iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed
  iw dev wlan1 del
done
ps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan

 39 kworker/R-wlan0
 98 kworker/R-wlan1
102 kworker/R-wlan1
105 kworker/R-wlan1
108 kworker/R-wlan1
111 kworker/R-wlan1

117 kworker/R-wlan1
120 kworker/R-wlan1
123 kworker/R-wlan1
126 kworker/R-wlan1
129 kworker/R-wlan1

Fix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation in
wilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant to
set it lowercase, however it is not  attached to a specific netdev, so
enforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich the
name with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.</td>

netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails

From abort path, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to
the original state. Currently, it uses the set->ops->walk() to iterate
over these set elements. The existing set iterator skips inactive
elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path
to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements
instead (not inactive ones).

This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator
callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which
needs to skip active elements.

Toggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is
invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the
next generation bit.

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path

The delete set command does not rely on the transaction object for
element removal, therefore, a combination of delete element + delete set
from the abort path could result in restoring twice the refcount of the
mapping.

Check for inactive element in the next generation for the delete element
command in the abort path, skip restoring state if next generation bit
has been already cleared. This is similar to the activate logic using
the set walk iterator.

					<td class=description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/pmu: Disable support for adaptive PEBS

Drop support for virtualizing adaptive PEBS, as KVM's implementation is
architecturally broken without an obvious/easy path forward, and because
exposing adaptive PEBS can leak host LBRs to the guest, i.e. can leak
host kernel addresses to the guest.

Bug #1 is that KVM doesn't account for the upper 32 bits of
IA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL when (re)programming fixed counters, e.g
fixed_ctrl_field() drops the upper bits, reprogram_fixed_counters()
stores local variables as u8s and truncates the upper bits too, etc.

Bug #2 is that, because KVM _always_ sets precise_ip to a non-zero value
for PEBS events, perf will _always_ generate an adaptive record, even if
the guest requested a basic record.  Note, KVM will also enable adaptive
PEBS in individual *counter*, even if adaptive PEBS isn't exposed to the
guest, but this is benign as MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG is guaranteed to be zero,
i.e. the guest will only ever see Basic records.

Bug #3 is in perf.  intel_pmu_disable_fixed() doesn't clear the upper
bits either, i.e. leaves ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE set, and
intel_pmu_enable_fixed() effectively doesn't clear ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE
either.  I.e. perf _always_ enables ADAPTIVE counters, regardless of what
KVM requests.

Bug #4 is that adaptive PEBS *might* effectively bypass event filters set
by the host, as "Updated Memory Access Info Group" records information
that might be disallowed by userspace via KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER.

Bug #5 is that KVM doesn't ensure LBR MSRs hold guest values (or at least
zeros) when entering a vCPU with adaptive PEBS, which allows the guest
to read host LBRs, i.e. host RIPs/addresses, by enabling "LBR Entries"
records.

Disable adaptive PEBS support as an immediate fix due to the severity of
the LBR leak in particular, and because fixing all of the bugs will be
non-trivial, e.g. not suitable for backporting to stable kernels.

Note!  This will break live migration, but trying to make KVM play nice
with live migration would be quite complicated, wouldn't be guaranteed to
work (i.e. KVM might still kill/confuse the guest), and it's not clear
that there are any publicly available VMMs that support adaptive PEBS,
let alone live migrate VMs that support adaptive PEBS, e.g. QEMU doesn't
support PEBS in any capacity.</td>

The system was under memory stress where driver was not able to allocate an
SRB to carry out error recovery of cable pull.  The failure to flush causes
upper layer to start modifying scsi_cmnd.  When the system frees up some
memory, the subsequent cable pull trigger another command flush. At this
point the driver access a null pointer when attempting to DMA unmap the
SGL.

Add a check to make sure commands are flush back on session tear down to
prevent the null pointer access.</td>
