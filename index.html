x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issue

It turns out that AMD has a "Meltdown Lite(tm)" issue with non-canonical
accesses in kernel space.  And so using just the high bit to decide
whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good
old "leak speculative data" if you have the right gadget using the
result:

  CVE-2020-12965 “Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses“

Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those
instructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures,
which closes the speculation window.

But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1].
That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the
speculation window is now open.

Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the
regular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm
version of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers.

It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since there's no
speculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.</td>

nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the
copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and
`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the
`migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.

This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may
contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.

To prevent this vulnerability, we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of
an error, a non-dirty (zero) page will be returned to the user.</td>

					<td class=date>2024-11-04T13:17:05.963</td>
					<td class=description>This vulnerability exists in Aero due to improper implementation of OTP validation mechanism in certain API endpoints. An authenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and manipulating the responses exchanged during the second factor authentication process.  

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass OTP verification for accessing other user accounts.</td>

					<td class=description>This vulnerability exists in the Wave 2.0 due to improper exception handling for invalid inputs at certain API endpoint. An authenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing invalid inputs for “userId” parameter in the API request leading to generation of error message containing sensitive information on the targeted system.</td>

					<td class=description>This vulnerability exists in the Wave 2.0 due to missing restrictions for excessive failed authentication attempts on its API based login. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a brute force attack against legitimate user OTP, MPIN or password, which could lead to gain unauthorized access and compromise other user accounts.</td>
