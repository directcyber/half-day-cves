					<td class=description>ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239.</td>

					<td class=description>ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. During the user avatar upload workflow, a user can choose to upload and change their avatar at any time. During deletion, ClipBucket checks for the avatar_url as a filepath within the avatars subdirectory. If the URL path exists within the avatars directory, ClipBucket will delete it. There is no check for path traversal sequences in the provided user input (stored in the DB as avatar_url) therefore the final $file variable could be tainted with path traversal sequences. This leads to file deletion outside of the intended scope of the avatars folder. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 237.</td>

					<td class=description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the command-line processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX1500, SRX4100, and SRX4200 devices allows a local, low-privileged authenticated attacker executing the 'show chassis environment pem' command to cause the chassis daemon (chassisd) to crash and restart, resulting in a temporary Denial of Service (DoS). However, repeated execution of this command will eventually cause the chassisd process to fail to restart, impacting packet processing on the system.

This issue affects Junos OS on SRX1500, SRX4100, SRX4200: 



  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9, 
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,

					<td class=description>An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series devices allows a local, low-privileged user with access to the Junos CLI to view the contents of sensitive files on the file system.

Through the execution of either 'show services advanced-anti-malware' or 'show services security-intelligence' command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low privilege login class user) can access protected files that should not be accessible to the user. These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system.
