When two or more cores observe that\nvma->numab_state is NULL at the same time, vma->numab_state will be\noverwritten.\n\nAlthough current code ensures that only one thread scans the VMAs in a\nsingle 'numa_scan_period', there might be a chance for another thread\nto enter in the next 'numa_scan_period' while we have not gotten till\nnumab_state allocation [1].\n\nNote that the command `/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/hackbench 50 process 1000`\ncannot the reproduce the issue. It is verified with 200+ test runs.\n\n[Solution]\nUse the cmpxchg atomic operation to ensure that only one thread executes\nthe vma->numab_state assignment.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1794be3c-358c-4cdc-a43d-a1f841d91ef7@amd.com/",
