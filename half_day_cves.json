    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put().
