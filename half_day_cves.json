This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included.",

Affected is an unknown function of the file /usr_account_set.cgi of the component HTTP GET Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument username/password leads to use of get request method with sensitive query strings. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.0.0 Build 20250124 Rel. 54920(Beta) is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was contacted early. They reacted very professional and provided a pre-fix version for their customers.",
