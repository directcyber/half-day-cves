This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, when the \"Two-Factor Authentication\" setting is enabled (disabled by default).",

This can result in no ACL being applied to the SNMP listening process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations that should be denied. The attacker has no control of the SNMP ACL configuration and would still need a valid SNMP version 2c (SNMPv2c) community string or SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) user credentials.\r\nSNMP with IPv6 ACL configurations is not affected.\r\nFor more information, see the  section of this advisory.",
