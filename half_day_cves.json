    "description": "n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions starting with 0.211.0 and prior to 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0 contain a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in their workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime. An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations: Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only; and/or deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation. These workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer\n\nWhen a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is\na probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is\nan access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.\nSpecifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function\nis called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the\nsg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been\nfreed.\n\nThe SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()\nin uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.\nWithin the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,\ndata_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may\noccur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result\nin URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully\nsubmitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV\nerror code in this case. The current error handling directly calls\nscsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()\nto invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully\nsubmitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call\nusb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg\nunmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.\n\nThis patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()\nfunction. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already\nbeen successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking\nscsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully\nsubmitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then\nthe scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after\nall pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()\nfunction will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs().\n\nThe error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls\nuas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,\nthe device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),\nwhere uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().",
