    "description": "OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\\r\\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\\r\\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.",

Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension.

Because the buffer is allocated when the last byte of the header has been copied, the combination of having a bad header length variable that will never match the counter variable and being able to overwrite the state variable with the resulting buffer overflow can be used to advance the function to the next step while skipping the buffer allocation and resulting pointer write.

    "description": "An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. When parsing hci reports, the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report, uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report, etc. In doing this, it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not, however, validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible, though unlikely, that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied, it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer, which may lead to a buffer overflow.",

    "description": "An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. Certain events cause a callback, the logic for which allocates a buffer (the length of which is determined by looking up the event type in a table). The subsequent write operation, however, copies the amount of data specified in the packet header, which may lead to a buffer overflow. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.",
