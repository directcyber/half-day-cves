    "description": "TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002R Firmware V1.1.1-B20200824 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. In the boa server program's CGI handling function formWlEncrypt, there is a lack of length restriction on the wlan_ssid field. This oversight leads to potential buffer overflow under specific circumstances. For instance, by invoking the formWlanRedirect function with specific parameters to alter wlan_idx's value and subsequently invoking the formWlEncrypt function, an attacker can trigger buffer overflow, enabling arbitrary command execution or denial of service attacks.",

    "description": "The OpenTelemetry Collector module AWS firehose receiver is for ingesting AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream messages and parsing the records received based on the configured record type. `awsfirehosereceiver` allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key. OpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. Firehose sets the header `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming requests with no key**. Only OpenTelemetry Collector users configured with the \u201calpha\u201d `awsfirehosereceiver` module are affected. This module was added in version v0.49.0 of the \u201cContrib\u201d distribution (or may be included in custom builds). There is a risk of unauthorized users writing metrics. Carefully crafted metrics could hide other malicious activity. There is no risk of exfiltrating data. It\u2019s likely these endpoints will be exposed to the public internet, as Firehose does not support private HTTP endpoints. A fix was introduced in PR #34847 and released with v0.108.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

    "description": "i-Educar is free, completely online school management software that allows school secretaries, teachers, coordinators and area managers. The lack of sanitization of user-controlled parameters for generating HTML field values ??dynamically leads to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. The dynamic generation of HTML fields in the ieducar/intranet/include/clsCampos.inc.php file does not perform the correct validation or sanitization, reflecting the user-controlled values ??to be shown in the page's HTML. This allows an attacker to inject a specific XSS payload into a parameter. Successful exploitation of this flaw allows an attacker to trick the victim into clicking a vulnerable URL, enabling JavaScript scripts to be executed in the browser. Due to the configuration of session cookies, with the HttpOnly and SameSite=Lax flags being defined, there is little an attacker can do to steal the session or force the victim to perform actions within the application. This issue hast been patched but a new release has not yet been made. Users are advised to contact the developer and to coordinate an update schedule.",
