    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 address\n\nThe device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in\nlinear memory that is managed by the driver.\n\nChanging the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked\nproperly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would\nresult in a warning [2] and a memory leak [3]. The problem is that the\nnew remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and\ntherefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.\n\nFix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre\nnet device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not\nchange, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of\nthe address and then decreasing it.\n\n[1]\n # ip link add name bla up type ip6gre local 2001:db8:1::1 remote 2001:db8:2::1 tos inherit ttl inherit\n # ip link set dev bla type ip6gre remote 2001:db8:3::1\n # ip link del dev bla\n # devlink dev reload pci/0000:01:00.0\n\n[2]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1682 at drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum.c:3002 mlxsw_sp_ipv6_addr_put+0x140/0x1d0\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1682 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3-custom-g86b5b55bc835 #151\nHardware name: Nvidia SN5600/VMOD0013, BIOS 5.13 05/31/2023\nRIP: 0010:mlxsw_sp_ipv6_addr_put+0x140/0x1d0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n mlxsw_sp_router_netdevice_event+0x55f/0x1240\n notifier_call_chain+0x5a/0xd0\n call_netdevice_notifiers_info+0x39/0x90\n unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x63e/0x9d0\n rtnl_dellink+0x16b/0x3a0\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x142/0x3f0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x50/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x242/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1de/0x420\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x2bd/0x320\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xd0\n do_syscall_64+0x9e/0x1a0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n\n[3]\nunreferenced object 0xffff898081f597a0 (size 32):\n  comm \"ip\", pid 1626, jiffies 4294719324\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    20 01 0d b8 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01   ...............\n    21 49 61 83 80 89 ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  !Ia.............\n  backtrace (crc fd9be911):\n    [<00000000df89c55d>] __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x1da/0x260\n    [<00000000ff2a1ddb>] mlxsw_sp_ipv6_addr_kvdl_index_get+0x281/0x340\n    [<000000009ddd445d>] mlxsw_sp_router_netdevice_event+0x47b/0x1240\n    [<00000000743e7757>] notifier_call_chain+0x5a/0xd0\n    [<000000007c7b9e13>] call_netdevice_notifiers_info+0x39/0x90\n    [<000000002509645d>] register_netdevice+0x5f7/0x7a0\n    [<00000000c2e7d2a9>] ip6gre_newlink_common.isra.0+0x65/0x130\n    [<0000000087cd6d8d>] ip6gre_newlink+0x72/0x120\n    [<000000004df7c7cc>] rtnl_newlink+0x471/0xa20\n    [<0000000057ed632a>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x142/0x3f0\n    [<0000000032e0d5b5>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x50/0x100\n    [<00000000908bca63>] netlink_unicast+0x242/0x390\n    [<00000000cdbe1c87>] netlink_sendmsg+0x1de/0x420\n    [<0000000011db153e>] ____sys_sendmsg+0x2bd/0x320\n    [<000000003b6d53eb>] ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n    [<00000000cae27c62>] __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xd0",

In affected versions an unexpected `REPLY_CCRYPT` or `REPLY_RMAC_I` may be introduced into an active stream when they should not be. Once RMAC_I message can be sent during a session, attacker with MITM access to the communication may intercept the original RMAC_I reply and save it. While the session continues, the attacker will record all of the replies and save them, till capturing the message to be replied (can be detected by ID, length or time based on inspection of visual activity next to the reader) Once attacker captures a session with the message to be replayed, he stops resetting the connection and waits for signal to perform the replay to of the PD to CP message (ex: by signaling remotely to the MIMT device or setting a specific timing). In order to replay, the attacker will craft a specific RMAC_I message in the proper seq of the execution, which will result in reverting the RMAC to the beginning of the session. At that phase - attacker can replay all the messages from the beginning of the session. This issue has been addressed in commit `298576d9` which is included in release version 3.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
