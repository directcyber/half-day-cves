    "cvss": 7.5,
    "description": "D-Tale is a visualizer for Pandas data structures. Users hosting versions D-Tale prior to 3.9.0 publicly can be vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF), allowing attackers to access files on the server. Users should upgrade to version 3.9.0, where the `Load From the Web` input is turned off by default. The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.9.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.",
