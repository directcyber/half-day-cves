    "description": "The ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.6 via the render_raw function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201csafe\u201d file types can be uploaded and included.",

    "description": "I have activated the CORS because I had a development ui that uses another port number then I forgot to remove it.\n\nSo what I just did is :\n- First removed the cors configuration that allows everyone to access it :\nbefore:\n```python\n    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode=\"asgi\", cors_allowed_origins=\"*\", ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for every one\n```\nafter:\n```python\n    cert_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/\"cert.pem\"\n    key_file_path = lollms_paths.personal_certificates/\"key.pem\"\n    if os.path.exists(cert_file_path) and os.path.exists(key_file_path):\n        is_https = True\n    else:\n        is_https = False        \n\n    # Create a Socket.IO server\n    sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode=\"asgi\", cors_allowed_origins=config.allowed_origins+[f\"https://localhost:{config['port']}\" if is_https else f\"http://localhost:{config['port']}\"], ping_timeout=1200, ping_interval=30)  # Enable CORS for selected origins\n```\n\n- Second, I have updated lollms to have two modes (a headless mode and a ui mode).\nAnd updated the /execute_code to block if the server is headless or is exposed\n```python\n@router.post(\"/execute_code\")\nasync def execute_code(request: Request):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes Python code and returns the output.\n\n    :param request: The HTTP request object.\n    :return: A JSON response with the status of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if lollmsElfServer.config.headless_server_mode:\n        return {\"status\":False,\"error\":\"Code execution is blocked when in headless mode for obvious security reasons!\"}\n\n    if lollmsElfServer.config.host==\"0.0.0.0\":\n        return {\"status\":False,\"error\":\"Code execution is blocked when the server is exposed outside for very obvipous reasons!\"}\n\n    try:\n        data = (await request.json())\n        code = data[\"code\"]\n        discussion_id = int(data.get(\"discussion_id\",\"unknown_discussion\"))\n        message_id = int(data.get(\"message_id\",\"unknown_message\"))\n        language = data.get(\"language\",\"python\")\n        \n\n\n        if language==\"python\":\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing python code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_python(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        if language==\"javascript\":\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing javascript code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_javascript(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        if language in [\"html\",\"html5\",\"svg\"]:\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing javascript code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_html(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        \n        elif language==\"latex\":\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing latex code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_latex(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        elif language in [\"bash\",\"shell\",\"cmd\",\"powershell\"]:\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing shell code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_bash(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        elif language in [\"mermaid\"]:\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing mermaid code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_mermaid(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        elif language in [\"graphviz\",\"dot\"]:\n            ASCIIColors.info(\"Executing graphviz code:\")\n            ASCIIColors.yellow(code)\n            return execute_graphviz(code, discussion_id, message_id)\n        return {\"status\": False, \"error\": \"Unsupported language\", \"execution_time\": 0}\n    except Exception as ex:\n        trace_exception(ex)\n        lollmsElfServer.error(ex)\n        return {\"status\":False,\"error\":str(ex)}\n```\n\nI also added an optional https mode and looking forward to add a full authentication with cookies and a personal session etc.\n\n\nAll updates will be in V 9.1 \n\n\nAgain, thanks alot for your work. I will make it harder next time, but if you find more bugs, just be my guest :)",
