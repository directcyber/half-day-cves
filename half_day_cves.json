    "description": "php-svg-lib is a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file parsing/rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.2, php-svg-lib fails to validate that font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url, which might leads to RCE on PHP < 8.0, and doesn't validate if external references are allowed. This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are using it, if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is passed by php-svg-lib. The `Style::fromAttributes(`), or the `Style::parseCssStyle()` should check the content of the `font-family` and prevents it to use a PHAR url, to avoid passing an invalid and dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done in the `Style::fromStyleSheets` might be reused. Libraries using this library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of restrictions, or even remote code execution, if they do not double check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib. Version 0.5.2 contains a fix for this issue.",

    "description": "Fiber is a web framework written in go. Prior to version 2.52.1, the CORS middleware allows for insecure configurations that could potentially expose the application to multiple CORS-related vulnerabilities. Specifically, it allows setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a wildcard (`*`) while also having the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true, which goes against recommended security best practices. The impact of this misconfiguration is high as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and expose the system to various types of attacks listed in the PortSwigger article linked in the references. Version 2.52.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, users may manually validate the CORS configurations in their implementation to ensure that they do not allow a wildcard origin when credentials are enabled. The browser fetch api, as well as browsers and utilities that enforce CORS policies, are not affected by this.",
