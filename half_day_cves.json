This affects the function EventPluginsManager::enabledPlugins of the file components/calendar/eventpluginsmanager.cpp of the component Theme File Handler. The manipulation of the argument pluginId leads to path traversal. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The patch is named 6cdf42916369ebf4ad5bd876c4dfa0170d7b2f01. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-253407. NOTE: This requires write access to user's home or the installation of third party global themes.",
