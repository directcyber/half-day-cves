Prior to version 1.11.1, when a server calls an upstream service using different auth tokens, axios-cache-interceptor returns incorrect cached responses, leading to authorization bypass. The cache key is generated only from the URL, ignoring request headers like `Authorization`. When the server responds with `Vary: Authorization` (indicating the response varies by auth token), the library ignores this, causing all requests to share the same cache regardless of authorization. Server-side applications (APIs, proxies, backend services) that use axios-cache-interceptor to cache requests to upstream services, handle requests from multiple users with different auth tokens, and upstream services replies on `Vary` to differentiate caches are affected. Browser/client-side applications (single user per browser session) are not affected. Services using different auth tokens to call upstream services will return incorrect cached data, bypassing authorization checks and leaking user data across different authenticated sessions. After `v1.11.1`, automatic `Vary` header support is now enabled by default. When server responds with `Vary: Authorization`, cache keys now include the authorization header value.

    "description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in qs (parse modules) allows HTTP DoS.This issue affects qs: < 6.14.1.\n\n\nSummaryThe arrayLimit\u00a0option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. Applications using arrayLimit\u00a0for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\nDetailsThe arrayLimit\u00a0option only checks limits for indexed notation (a[0]=1&a[1]=2) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2).\n\nVulnerable code\u00a0(lib/parse.js:159-162):\n\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking code\u00a0(lib/parse.js:175):\n\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses utils.combine([], leaf)\u00a0without validating against options.arrayLimit, while indexed notation at line 175 checks index <= options.arrayLimit\u00a0before creating arrays.\n\nPoCTest 1 - Basic bypass:\n\nnpm install qs\n\n\n\n\n\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n\n\n\n\n\nTest 2 - DoS demonstration:\n\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration:\n\n  *  arrayLimit: 5\u00a0(test 1) or arrayLimit: 100\u00a0(test 2)\n  *  Use bracket notation: a[]=value\u00a0(not indexed a[0]=value)\n\n\nImpactDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using qs.parse()\u00a0with user-controlled input and arrayLimit\u00a0for protection.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n  *  Attacker sends HTTP request: GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x\u00a0(100,000+ times)\n  *  Application parses with qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })\n  *  qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n  *  Server memory exhausted \u2192 application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n  *  Service unavailable for all users\nReal-world impact:\n\n  *  Single malicious request can crash server\n  *  No authentication required\n  *  Easy to automate and scale\n  *  Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation",

    "description": "coturn is a free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Versions 4.6.2r5 through 4.7.0-r4 have a bad random number generator for nonces and port randomization after refactoring. Additionally, random numbers aren't generated with openssl's RAND_bytes but libc's random() (if it's not running on Windows). When fetching about 50 sequential nonces (i.e., through sending 50 unauthenticated allocations requests) it is possible to completely reconstruct the current state of the random number generator, thereby predicting the next nonce. This allows authentication while spoofing IPs. An attacker can send authenticated messages without ever receiving the responses, including the nonce (requires knowledge of the credentials, which is e.g., often the case in IoT settings). Since the port randomization is deterministic given the pseudorandom seed, an attacker can exactly reconstruct the ports and, hence predict the randomization of the ports. If an attacker allocates a relay port, they know the current port, and they are able to predict the next relay port (at least if it is not used before). Commit 11fc465f4bba70bb0ad8aae17d6c4a63a29917d9 contains a fix.",

Starting in version 4.29.0 and prior to version 4.29.3, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Serverless Framework's built-in MCP server package (@serverless/mcp). This vulnerability only affects users of the experimental MCP server feature (serverless mcp), which represents less than 0.1% of Serverless Framework users. The core Serverless Framework CLI and deployment functionality are not affected. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Version 4.29.3 fixes the issue.",
